the components and codes were built for an algae cultivation vessel using inorganic carbon (CO2), and light energy (from LED for the Sun), but the principle works for other systems, e.g. indoor plantation, other microbial culvation systems.

- high powered LED control that mimicking a pre-defined solar pattern for one day. More details on instructables.com: https://www.instructables.com/id/Control-High-powered-LED-Panel-by-Arduino-Real-Tim/
- data logger for pH, DO, and temperature, timestamp. More details here: https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Data-Logger-for-the-Temperature-PH-a/
- a turbidity monitoring and control using infra-red sensor, applied to measure and control algal biomass density. Link to a journal publication: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211926417307683
